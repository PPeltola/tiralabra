# NUMERAATTORI

This project aims to develop a MNIST-data classifying neural net from scratch.

[Specifications](https://github.com/PPeltola/tiralabra/blob/main/documentation/Specifications.md) for the project. These will be updated along the way when I understand the subject better

### Reading the dataset

You need to download the [data, all four files](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) and extract them to a folder named data in the root of the project. Keep the file names as they are, or if you wish to change them you need to change the constants in the Data.py as well.
