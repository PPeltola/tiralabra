### Testing

Testing is something that my project very much lacks. *Vector* is the only properly tested class and the only other test besides that is the output layer backpropagation test. It is an integration test but it's the only integration test in the whole project and it doesn't test the program end-to-end (since it only tests the first layer of backpropagation). The total testing coverage is 66%, but a lot of that is only thanks to the only integration test.
