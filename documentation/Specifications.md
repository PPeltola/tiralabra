### A simple neural net

I'm coding in English and writing the documentation in english, but I'd like to write the weekly reports in Finnish since those include more rambling. I'm in the TKT-kandi program.

I plan on implementing a basic neural net, starting from a single neuron and then combining them to make a neural net. I'll be using the well-known [MNIST](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) data of handwriten digits as my problem to solve, so the goal is to classify the handwritten digits as corrctly as possible. For the neural net I'll be implementing, I want to experiment with different simple designs (i.e. linear transformations vs affine transformations) and activation functions (i.e. step vs sigmoid vs relu vs softmax). For the learning algorithm I'll implement backpropagation, but I might research and try implementing other ways of adjusting the weights of neurons too, if I have enough time and energy. During the project I want to focus on experimentation, since I don't have a lot of hands-on experience with neural nets and direct experimentation is a fun way to learn. I'll update this document as I learn more about the topic and the challenges with different approaches better.
